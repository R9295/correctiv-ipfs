# correctiv-ipfs
Compiles articles by https://correctiv.org into PDFs and pushes them to IPFS.

### Warning:
Permission needs to be obtained from the team @ CORRECTIV for such distribution of content. Also, PhantomJS fails to render CSS if the CSS file has ``@media`` queries with ``!important`` rules within. Modification of their CSS file will (I think) also require their permission. Please keep in mind when interacting with the code! This will change once correctiv-ipfs is in alpha and a proposal is written!
